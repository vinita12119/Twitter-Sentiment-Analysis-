##Twitter Sentiment Detection
In this project, I was asked to build a binary classification model using fully connected feed-forward neural networks in Keras

Dataset: 
Dataset had 100000 tweets in total. Each tweet has two columns: sentiment text and the corresponding sentiment label (0: negative, 1: positive). 
Train & Test Split :
Train: 80000 tweets to build the model 
Validation/Test: 20000 as the validation set to evaluate and report the performance 

Steps Followed:
1. Used the dataset containing 100000 tweets to run Sentiment Analysis and get the binary sentiment labels (0: negative, 1: positive). 
2. Used Twitter Sentiment Detection Part 1 file to perform sentiment prediction using the fully connected feed-forward neural networks in Keras
